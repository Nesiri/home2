    <h2> <em>Early Life</em></h2>
    <p> Born in the eastern suburbs of Paris, Paul Pogba is the youngest of three children whose life would inevitably be attached to soccer.
     His elder brothers, Florentin and Mathias (who are twins), were born in Guinea three years earlier, living 
     with their mother Yeo Moriba before moving to France, where their father Fassou Antoine was already settled. 

     Paul was born only a few months after her mother joined her husband in France, therefore having a different nationality than the rest of his family.
     His early life was not easy, though, as Paul didn’t get to see their parents living together for long. Paul would kick off his career at six, joining US Roissy-En-Brie.
      He would stay in the academy for the next seven years before taking the first big step in his road to the elite level.
